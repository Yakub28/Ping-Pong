### Ping Pong Game
This is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The goal of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle and prevent it from hitting the wall behind the paddle. If a player misses the ball, the other player earns a point. The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.

### How to Play
1) Run the project files using a Python IDE.

2) The game window will open and the ball will start moving towards one of the paddles randomly.

3) Player 1 (left paddle) uses the 'w' and 's' keys to move their paddle up and down respectively.

4) Player 2 (right paddle) uses the '8' and '2' keys to move their paddle up and down respectively.

5) If a player misses the ball, the other player earns a point and the ball will reset to the center of the screen.

6) To exit the game, simply close the game window.
